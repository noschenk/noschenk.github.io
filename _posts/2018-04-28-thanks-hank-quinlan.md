I recently started to work with github and I am amazed - constantly I stumble over new useful things as for example [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). If you have a Github profile, you can create your own homepage quite easy. Github's own tutorial explains well how to set the page up and whithin short time you have a website! However, that is in html. For people like me who do not speak html, there is [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Jekyll allows you to write blog posts in Markdown, which I find much easier to begin with.

Setting up Jekyll was quite confusing for me (being a noop when it comes to Web development stuff). Luckily, I found [Hank Quinlans site](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) written by [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/) with a very detailed and good Tutorial of setting up a page. In this place - thank you so much! There is not only this amazing tutorial, but also a whole Github repository ([Hank Quinlans Github repo](https://github.com/hankquinlan/hankquinlan.github.io)) where you can look up or copy out things to setup the page.

```{r}
vec <- c(2,3,4)
```

Well, let's see how this blog develops.
