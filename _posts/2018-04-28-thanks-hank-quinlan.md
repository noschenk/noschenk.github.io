As I recently started to work with github, I discovered there is something called [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Of corse I wanted to do a page as well! So I first went with Github's own tutorial, which was very good. However, as I don't speak html, I decided to use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) as this allows me to write blog posts in Markdown. 

Setting up Jekyll was quite confusing for me (as a complete noop to all Web development stuff). Luckily, I found [Hank Quinlans site](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) written by [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/) with a very detailed and good Tutorial of setting up a page. Thank you so much! As if the page with the tutorial was not enough, there is a whole Github repository from him ([Hank Quinlans Github repo](https://github.com/hankquinlan/hankquinlan.github.io)) where I could look up (the few) things I didn't understand from the tutorial. 

Well, let's see how this blog develops.
