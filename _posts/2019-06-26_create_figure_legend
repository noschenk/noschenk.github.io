Figure descriptions are extremely important. What I currently miss is kind of a "cheat sheet" list with the must-haves of a good caption. Here it is:

A figure should be able to stand alone, the caption should be able to make somebody understand the figure without reading the text (entirely).

### General
- Figure captions below, for a table above
- Is your figure really worth to be a figure? Wouldn't it be easier to have it as a text?
- "Figure" is abbreviated to "Fig." in the text, but "Table" is not abbreviated. In descriptive legends, both words are spelled.
- smaller font (but same) than the main text
- "Table X;"

### Title
- short, active voice
- sentence that summarises major results or states type of analysis used
- in context of study question

### Methods
- only minimal, just what is absolutely needed to understand the figure
- techniques used, model, organism, statistical tests, numbers of replicates/ repeats, ... 
- summary statistics plotted (e.g. mean and SEM)

### Results
- if title does not state it already or if there are multiple results
- p-values, sample size

### Definitions
- explanation of all symbols, patterns, lines, colors, non-standard abbreviations, scale bars, error bars (standard error or standard deviation?)
    - e.g. ; * p<0.05, ** p<0.001
- all non-intuitive features

- place labels on the graphics, not in the caption (--> easier to read)
- don't use abbreviations (or just use those which are also used in the text)
