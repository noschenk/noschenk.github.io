I would like to share a great book tip which I got from Marc: "How to Write and Publish a Scientific Paper". The first edition of this book was published in 1979. Since then it has been updated many times. The version I will present you here is an edition from Barbara Gastel which she wrote together with the original author, Robert A. Day.

The book gives practical tips about how to approach the task of writing and publishing. I am reading it while writing my master thesis, so I will skip the part about publishing in my little summary below. I want to give you a little impression of what types of tips you can get out of the book and hopefully make you read the book. By the way, it is very easy to read, although I am not at all a native English speaker, I was able to understand the content easily and read through quite fast. That is already the first beautiful thing about this book. While reading it, I notice how the writer fulfills all her inputs and tips. The whole book is a template of how to write a paper (or - a book, of course).


# Chapter 3 - Approaching a writing project
Focus on writing very **clearly** and understandably. It should not be a literary text, but the main reason of writing down science is to **make others understand** it.

**Read similar papers** and copy their style (subheadings, lengths of sections, how many figures and tables, the way they are commented, typical sentences etc.)

Write down thoughts and ideas for writing early (even before starting to write actively).

**Present** your work to others, speaking helps writing, and the questions your audience asks may help you find weaknesses or strengths of your work.

Do a lot of **pre-writing**! Sort the papers you would like to cite in the order of citation, prepare your outlines, etc. Draft the paper with bullet points and take the time to order them until you (and your supervisors) agree on the order.

Write sections in any order, whatever fits to your mood. (e.g. first the introduction, then the results, ...)

Leave notes where detail information will be needed to fill in. Don't get yourself out of the writing flow by clarifying all the small details, it is enough for the start that you establish the order in which the information is given.

When you stop writing, leave a little **note for future-you** that explains you where you have stopped and what is the next action to do.

**Revise!** Many times! Count on it from the start.

Let the draft be **revised by others**, ideally by one person from your field, one person in your general field and an "external" person interested in the content.

The "shape" of the whole paper should be the shape of an **hourglass**.

 Provide broad orientation about the general research area in the beginning and e.g. state why the content is important, then narrow down on the specific research and in the end, put your findings into a broader context.


# Chapter 5 - Ethics
Report well your data, e.g. **outliers** and plan well your experiments.

Submit to one journal at once to not waste peer-rewiev power.

Put findings which belong together in the same paper, not in separate ones.

Run a **plagiarism-checking software** your own, e.g. CrossCheck or Turnitin.

Acknowledge all help. (There is a whole chapter about it)

# Chapter 7 - Title
Find the **fewest possible words to adequatly describe the content**

Check **syntax** carefully! No wrong word orders allowed. (There are some very funny examples of wrong word orders which change the meaning of the title, you will find them if you read the book:))

Avoid "assertive sentence titles" like *Dogs are intelligent*. Such sentences are to omit in a paper, as they are to omit in the title.

Use (all) important terms in the title.

No **abbreviations**, jargon or proprietary names.

# Chapter 9 - Abstract
The abstract should consist of a **summary of each section**, around 250 words.

It should first state objectives and scope,
