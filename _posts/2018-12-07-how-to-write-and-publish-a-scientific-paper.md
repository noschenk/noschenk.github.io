I would like to share a great book tip from Marc here. ![howtowrite_gastel]({{ "/assets/howtowrite_gastel.jpg" | absolute_url }}). The first edition of this book was published in 1979, since then it has been republished many times. The version I will present you here is an edition from Barbara Gastel which she wrote together with the original author, Robert A. Day.
